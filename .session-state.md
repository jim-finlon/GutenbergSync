# Session State

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-08  
**Current Phase:** Foundation Complete ✅  
**Next Phase:** Core Services Implementation

## Current Status

### Completed

- ✅ Technical specification (v1.2) - Complete with all improvements
- ✅ README.md - Complete with all features documented
- ✅ All 10 quality improvements added to specifications
- ✅ Continuity files created (.session-state, .lessons-learned, .task-list, .resume)
- ✅ Project configuration files (.gitignore, .cursorrules)
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Initial commit to main branch
- ✅ Working branch created: feature/foundation-setup
- ✅ Updated to .NET 9.0 (from .NET 8.0)
- ✅ Solution and project structure created
- ✅ All projects build successfully
- ✅ .NET 9.0 verified installed

### Completed
- ✅ Solution and project structure
- ✅ Configuration system (models, validator, loader)
- ✅ Platform detection utilities
- ✅ rsync discovery service (complete implementation)
- ✅ Configuration loader (JSON + environment variables)
- ✅ Logging infrastructure (Serilog setup)
- ✅ Sample configuration file

### In Progress
- ✅ Dependency injection setup
- Core services implementation
  - ✅ LanguageMapper (80+ languages, bidirectional mapping)
  - ✅ RsyncService (progress tracking, WSL support, options)
  - ✅ RdfParser (RDF/XML parsing, metadata extraction, language mapping)
  - ✅ CatalogRepository (SQLite database, FTS5 search, CRUD operations, exports)
  - ✅ TextExtractor (text extraction, chunking, header/footer stripping, multiple formats)
- CLI implementation
  - ✅ All core commands (sync, catalog, extract, config, health)
  - ✅ Dependency injection setup
  - ✅ Command-line argument parsing
- Sync orchestration
  - ✅ SyncOrchestrator with metadata-first strategy
  - ✅ Two-phase sync (metadata → content)
  - ✅ Content sync using catalog as checklist
  - ✅ SyncPresets for content filtering
  - ✅ Progress reporting with Spectre.Console
- Audit and verification
  - ✅ AuditService for file integrity verification
  - ✅ SHA-256 checksum calculation
  - ✅ Directory scanning and catalog verification
  - ✅ AuditCommand CLI with scan/verify subcommands
- Testing
  - ✅ Initial unit tests (LanguageMapper, GutenbergMarkers, SyncPresets)
  - ✅ All tests passing

### Pending
- Solution file creation (.sln)
- Project files creation (CLI, Core, Tests)
- Implementation of core components

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Metadata-First Sync Strategy**: Build catalog from RDF files first, then sync content
2. **Incremental Extraction**: Track extraction state to avoid re-processing
3. **Language Mapping**: Accept both language names and ISO codes with automatic mapping
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Allow sync and extract to run concurrently with verification
5. **Database Location**: Default to `{targetDirectory}/gutenberg.db`, configurable
6. **Full Metadata in Chunks**: Each RAG chunk includes complete book metadata
7. **Multiple Export Formats**: Support JSON, Parquet, Arrow, compressed JSON
8. **Quality Validation**: Validate chunks and report quality metrics
9. **Health/Status Command**: Quick overview of system state
10. **Configuration Validation**: Validate config on startup with clear errors

## Architecture Decisions

- **.NET 9.0** for runtime
- **SQLite** for catalog database
- **rsync** for synchronization (auto-detected)
- **Metadata-first** approach for sync
- **Incremental extraction** by default
- **File-level locking** for concurrent operations

## Next Steps

1. Set up dependency injection container
2. Implement core services:
   - RsyncService
   - RdfParser
   - CatalogRepository
   - TextExtractor
3. Implement CLI commands

## Git Status

- **Main branch**: Initial commit complete
- **Current branch**: feature/foundation-setup
- **Last commit**: Milestone 2 (Foundation Ready) complete
- **Commits on branch**: 13 commits
- **Ready to merge**: Foundation phase complete, ready for core services

## Progress Summary

- **Files created**: 64+ C# files
- **Lines of code**: ~5,200+ lines
- **Commits**: 40+ commits on feature branch
- **Milestones**: M1 (Planning) ✅, M2 (Foundation) ✅, M3 (Core Services) ✅

## Notes

- All documentation is at v1.2
- Foundation phase complete
- Ready to begin core services implementation
- Next: RsyncService, RdfParser, CatalogRepository, TextExtractor
