# Lessons Learned

## Project Planning Phase

### Documentation Best Practices
- **Version control for docs**: Increment version numbers when making significant changes
- **Comprehensive requirements**: Include all improvements upfront to avoid scope creep
- **User stories**: Help clarify acceptance criteria and priorities
- **Technical specs**: Detailed enough to guide implementation without being prescriptive

### Key Insights

1. **Metadata-First Strategy**: Building catalog before content sync provides early value and better tracking
2. **Incremental Operations**: Critical for large datasets - saves significant time on re-runs
3. **Selective Extraction**: Enables targeted RAG dataset creation without full processing
4. **Quality Metrics**: Important for ensuring RAG data quality - catch issues early
5. **Configuration Validation**: Fail fast with clear errors - better UX than runtime failures

### Design Decisions

- **Auto-detection over configuration**: rsync discovery reduces setup friction
- **Database path flexibility**: Default to target directory but allow override
- **Concurrent operations**: Enable parallel workflows with proper safety mechanisms
- **Multiple export formats**: Support different use cases (RAG, analytics, ML)

### Areas for Future Consideration

- Performance benchmarks for large archives (76K+ books)
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed metadata
- Compression options for extracted chunks
- Integration with popular RAG frameworks (optional enhancement)
