Subject: Persistent GPG Key Error for Linux APT Repository (NO_PUBKEY 42A1772E62E492D6) - Affecting Users for Months

Hello Cursor Support Team,

I am reporting a persistent and widespread issue with the Cursor IDE Linux APT repository that has been affecting users for months, if not since the repository was first established. This issue prevents `apt-get update` from completing successfully on Linux systems.

---

## Problem Summary

The Cursor APT repository (`https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo`) fails GPG signature verification because the required public key (ID: `42A1772E62E492D6`) cannot be obtained through standard methods.

**Error Message:**
```
Err:12 https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo stable InRelease
  The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 42A1772E62E492D6
W: GPG error: https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo stable InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 42A1772E62E492D6
E: The repository 'https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo stable InRelease' is not signed.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

I have performed a technical analysis and identified the following issues:

### 1. GPG Key Download URL Returns 403 Forbidden
The documented method for obtaining the GPG key fails:
- URL: `https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo/gpg.key`
- Result: HTTP 403 Forbidden
- Impact: Automated installation scripts and manual key retrieval fail

### 2. Key Not Available on Public Keyservers
The key cannot be retrieved from standard GPG keyservers:
- Tested: `keyserver.ubuntu.com`, `hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80`
- Result: "gpg: keyserver receive failed: No data"
- Impact: Users cannot retrieve the key using standard GPG methods

### 3. Repository Files Are Properly Signed
The repository's `InRelease` file contains valid PGP signatures, indicating:
- The signing infrastructure is working correctly
- The issue is purely with key distribution, not signing

### 4. Empty Keyring Files Created
During installation, empty keyring files (0 bytes) are created at:
- `/usr/share/keyrings/cursor.gpg`
- `/usr/share/keyrings/cursor-archive-keyring.gpg`

This suggests the key download is failing silently during the installation process.

---

## Impact

- **Blocks System Updates**: Users must disable the Cursor repository to allow `apt-get update` to complete
- **Prevents Cursor Updates**: Users cannot receive security patches or bug fixes via APT
- **Poor User Experience**: Requires manual workarounds that are not documented
- **Widespread Issue**: This has been reported by multiple users on forums for months

---

## Current Workaround

Users are forced to manually comment out the repository:
```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^deb/#deb/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cursor.list
```

This prevents Cursor updates but allows other package management to function.

## Recommended Fixes

### Option 1: Fix GPG Key Download URL (Highest Priority)
- Ensure `https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo/gpg.key` returns HTTP 200 with the public key
- Verify the key file is accessible without authentication
- Test from multiple locations to ensure it's not blocked

### Option 2: Publish Key to Public Keyservers
- Upload the GPG public key (ID: `42A1772E62E492D6`) to major keyservers:
  - keyserver.ubuntu.com
  - pgp.mit.edu
  - keys.openpgp.org
- Verify the key is retrievable via standard GPG commands

### Option 3: Use Modern Keyring Approach
Update repository configuration to use `signed-by` directive:
```bash
deb [arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cursor.gpg] https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo stable main
```

Ensure the installer properly downloads and installs the key to this location.

### Option 4: Document and Use Working Key Location
I discovered that `https://downloads.cursor.com/keys/anysphere.asc` successfully returns a valid GPG key. However, this URL is:
- Not documented in official installation instructions
- Not automatically used by the installer
- Only discovered through community forums and troubleshooting

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify this key matches the repository signing key (ID: 42A1772E62E492D6)
- Update the installer to use this URL if it's the correct key
- Document this URL in official installation instructions
- Ensure the installer properly downloads and installs this key

## System Information

- **OS**: Linux Mint (Ubuntu-based)
- **Issue Duration**: Months to potentially since repository creation
- **Repository URL**: https://downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo
- **Key ID**: 42A1772E62E492D6
- **Repository Status**: Properly signed, but key distribution broken

---

## Verification Steps

To verify this issue on any Linux system:

1. Check repository configuration:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cursor.list
   ```

2. Attempt to update package lists:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update 2>&1 | grep -i cursor
   ```

3. Check for keyring files:
   ```bash
   ls -la /usr/share/keyrings/ | grep cursor
   ```

4. Verify key file size (should not be 0 bytes):
   ```bash
   ls -lh /usr/share/keyrings/cursor.gpg
   ```

---

## Additional Notes

- The Cursor installer/updater appears to create empty keyring files, suggesting the key download fails during installation
- The repository itself is functional and properly signed; only key distribution is broken
- This affects all Linux users who install Cursor via the APT repository method
- Community forums show this has been an ongoing issue with multiple user reports

---

## Request

I request that the Cursor team:
1. Investigate and fix the GPG key distribution mechanism
2. Ensure the key is available via the documented URL and public keyservers
3. Update the installer to properly download and install the key
4. Provide clear documentation for manual key installation if needed
5. Test the fix across multiple Linux distributions

I have attached a detailed technical analysis document (`CURSOR_GPG_KEY_ISSUE.md`) with additional information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. This issue significantly impacts the user experience for Linux users and should be prioritized for resolution.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
